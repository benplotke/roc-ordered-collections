# roc-ordered-collections

This repo is for Ordered Collections implemented in Roc. Because Roc does not yet have [Sort Ability](https://www.roc-lang.org/abilities#sort-ability), nor does Roc yet have [importing of custom Abilities](https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/issues/6702), you will need to vendor the collection directly into every module you wish to use it in.

On a personal note, I came up with the red-black tree delete method myself, but I would be surprised if my solution has not been published already.
